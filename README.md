Similar to the Horsepower vs price graph the enginesize vs price plot also shows us a large positive correlation relationship(correlation coefficient:0.874).So,as the enginesize becomes biiger so is the price.

Grouped the drivewheel_type into three categories namely 'fwd','rwd','4wd'.The count of cars under each category is 120,76,9. Majority of the cars have a 'fwd' around 58.5% while 'rwd' and '4wd' occupy 37% and 4.39% respectively.
Among the three the 'fwd' has the lowest Avg price which might be the reason why alot of people prefered the 'fwd' cars for their low prices.Coming to 'rwd' and '4wd' although the 'rwd' cars are much high priced than the '4wd' but  more people prefered 'rwd'.This shows us that people are interested in buying 'rwd' cars despite their high price.
